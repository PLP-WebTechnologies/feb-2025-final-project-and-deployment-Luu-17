             <h4>Brass Instruments</h4>
             <p>The string section is the largest and most prominent group of instruments in the orchestra. It consists of four main instruments, all played with a bow and belonging to the violin family:</p>
             <ul class="list">
               <li>Trumpet</li>
               <li>French harmonic</li>
               <li>Trombone</li>
               <li>Euphonium</li>
               <li>Tuba</li>
             </ul>


             <h2>Timbre of Specific String instruments</h2>
             <p>
                <b>Trumpet</b> <br><br>
                The trumpet has a bright, sharp, and piercing timbre. Its sound is bold and vibrant, capable of cutting through even the loudest orchestral sections. When played softly, it has a clear, mellow tone, but when played forcefully, it becomes brassy and brilliant.

             </p>

             <p>
                <b>French Horn</b> <br><br>
                The French horn produces a warm, rich, and smooth timbre. Its sound is more mellow and rounded compared to other brass instruments, with a slightly haunting quality in its lower register. The French horn is known for its expressive capabilities, often evoking a sense of nobility and grandeur.

             </p>

             <p>
                <b>Euphonium</b> <br><br>
                The trombone has a strong, full, and resonant timbre. Its sound is powerful and bold in the lower register, while it becomes bright and brassy as it moves higher. The trombone's slide mechanism allows for smooth glissandos, adding a unique expressiveness to its tone.

             </p>

             <p>
                <b>Tuba</b> <br><br>
                The tuba has the deepest and most powerful timbre in the brass family. Its sound is full, rich, and resonant, providing the foundation for brass sections. The tubaâ€™s tone is thick and booming in the lower register, while it remains surprisingly smooth and rounded in higher notes.
