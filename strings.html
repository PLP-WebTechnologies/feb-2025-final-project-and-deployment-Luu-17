             <h4>String Instruments</h4>
             <p>The string section is the largest and most prominent group of instruments in the orchestra. It consists of four main instruments, all played with a bow and belonging to the violin family:</p>
             <ul class="list">
                <li>First Violines</li>
                <li>Second Violins</li>
                <li>Violas</li>
                <li>Cellos</li>
                <li>Double Basses</li>
             </ul>


             <h2>Timbre of Specific String instruments</h2>

            
             <p><b>Violin</b><br><br>
                The violin has a bright, clear, and penetrating timbre. It can sound both sweet and brilliant, capable of delicate, lyrical melodies or intense, fiery passages. When bowed smoothly, it produces a singing tone, while pizzicato (plucked) notes have a crisp, percussive quality.</p>
            <p>
                <b>Viola</b> <br><br>
                Slightly larger than the violin, the viola has a warmer, darker, and more mellow timbre. Its sound is rich and woody, providing a beautiful middle voice in orchestras. The viola’s tone is less brilliant but more earthy and full-bodied.
            </p>

            <p><b>Cello</b><br><br>
                The cello has a deep, rich, and resonant timbre that can range from warm and lyrical to powerful and sonorous. It’s known for its vocal-like quality, often described as soulful or expressive. The lower range gives it a mellow, rounded tone, while higher notes can be bright and singing.
            </p>

            <p><b>Double Basses</b><br><br>
                The double bass produces the lowest and most robust timbre among string instruments. Its sound is deep, dark, and earthy, with a strong fundamental tone and fewer high harmonics. It provides a solid foundation in the orchestra with a powerful, resonant quality.
