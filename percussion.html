             <h4>Percussion Instruments</h4>
             <p>Percussion instruments are the heartbeat of music, adding rhythm, texture, and dramatic impact. Their timbre varies widely, depending on whether they are struck, shaken, or scraped. They are divided into two main categories: pitched (capable of playing specific notes) and unpitched (producing sounds without definite pitch).</p>

                The marimba's timbre is warm, rich, and mellow. It has a deeper, more resonant sound compared to the xylophone due to its larger wooden bars and resonators. Its tone is smooth and earthy, perfect for lyrical passages.

                <b>Vibraphone</b> <br><br>
                The vibraphone produces a soft, shimmering, and metallic timbre. Its sustained, bell-like tones are enriched with vibrato, giving it an ethereal, almost haunting quality. It’s often used in jazz and modern classical pieces.
             </p>

            <p>
                <b>Glockenspiel</b> <br><br>
                The glockenspiel has a bright, pure, and sparkling timbre. Its metal bars produce a very sharp and ringing sound, almost like tiny bells. The glockenspiel is often used for accenting melodies with a magical, fairy-like quality.
